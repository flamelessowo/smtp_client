# SMTP Client

This is my smtp client, for recreational purposes. It supports 2 auth extensions (PLAIN, LOGIN) defined in RFC 3207. You can use it as a library or a cli tool.
You can successfully send mails to popular smtp servers such as google and others with implemented auth extensions. Ports supported 465(SSL encrypted socket), 587(TLS handshake upgrade after ehlo).

I do not recommend to use it at all).
